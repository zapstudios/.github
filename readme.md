# welcome to zap! ⚡

Zap is a project by 2 fellow web developers who love to make the most out of current times tools. 
Out of that, our project **pearl** formed - a software-as-a-service product, made for both coders & non-coders to have easier and more structured access
to the tools the web provides for us. 

We don't like the idea of extremly useful web tools (such as [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)) only to be provided to developers, why does everything need to be
as complicated as possible? Thats the reason **zap ⚡** exists - we make easy tools.
